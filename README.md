# CS4331 VR Project 1: Covid-19 Martial Arts
## Project Description and Theme

The objective of Project 1 was to make a VR enviornment that showed how Covid-19 and the lockdowns affected you. 
Covid-19 affected all of us in different ways and some aspects of our lifestyles started to change.
One of those changes, for me, was the closing down of Martial Arts gyms.
6 weeks before lockdown happened in March 2020, I started doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu(BJJ) at the Texas Tech Rec Center. 
During the lockdowns, the Jiu-Jitsu club at Tech and all Martial Arts gyms around the world shut down. 
Therefore, through a Virtual Environment setting, I would like to show everyone how Covid-19 affect Martial Arts gyms. 

## The Environment

I started by building the walls of my Martial Arts Gym and incorporated BJJ wall papers. 
The floor is a simple plane object and the roof is an a 3d model that I found online.
